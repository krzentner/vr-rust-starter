# vr-rust-starter

This repo is intended to collect some simple examples and utilities for making VR games in Rust.

Right now, it contains a single example, a very literal port of [hellovr_vulkan_main.cpp](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr/blob/master/samples/hellovr_vulkan/hellovr_vulkan_main.cpp).

To run that example:
```bash
cargo run --bin hellovr
```

Note that the first time it runs it will download a few assets from the OpenVR SDK linked above.
